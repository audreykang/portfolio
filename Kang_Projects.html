				 		<p><b>Project:</b> Scratch Interactive Story</p>
				 		<p><b>Course:</b> CSE (Computer Science and Engineering)</p>
				 		<p><b>Duration:</b> August 2017 - September 2017</p>
				 		<p><b>Objective:</b> Create an interactive story using Scratch</p>
				 		<p><b>Type of Project:</b> Pair Coding</p>

				 		<p>For the Scratch Project, my partner, Yoga Kanneboina, and I had to
				 		first come up with a story idea that was both interactive and interesting.
				 		The <a href="PDF/scratch.pdf" target="_blank">requirements</a> were that the story be user-interactive and to have
				 		different paths that the story could go down depending on how the 
				 		user responded to the prompts on the screen. Previously, we had been given
				 		an <a href="PDF/scratchactivityone.pdf" target="_blank">assignment</a> that taught us how to use Scratch to create a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/171884670/"
				 		target="_blank">simple game</a>.
				 		We also had another <a href="PDF/scratchanimation.pdf" target="_blank">assignment</a> that taught us some Scratch animation basics
				 		that we used to create a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/171997928/" target="_blank">simple story</a>.Our interactive story had
				 		multiple riddles that progressively got harder as the player advanced through the game. Throughout the game,
				 		the player has to use their arrow keys on the keyboard to maneuver the character around the screen in order to "touch"
				 		the object that is the answer to the riddle. The theme of our project was an Escape Room, and the 
				 		main objective of the game was to make it out of the mansion that you start in.
