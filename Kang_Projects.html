				 		<p><b>Project:</b> Scratch Interactive Story</p>
				 		<p><b>Course:</b> CSE (Computer Science and Engineering)</p>
				 		<p><b>Duration:</b> August 2017 - September 2017</p>
				 		<p><b>Objective:</b> Create an interactive story using Scratch</p>
				 		<p><b>Type of Project:</b> Pair Coding</p>
				 		</br>
				 		<p>For the Scratch Project, my partner, Yoga Kanneboina, and I had to
				 		first come up with a story idea that was both interactive and interesting.
				 		The <a href="PDF/scratch.pdf" target="_blank">requirements</a> were that the story be user-interactive and to have
				 		different paths that the story could go down depending on how the 
				 		user responded to the prompts on the screen. Previously, we had been given
				 		an <a href="PDF/scratchactivityone.pdf" target="_blank">assignment</a> that taught us how to use Scratch to create a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/171884670/"
				 		target="_blank">simple game</a>.
				 		We also had another <a href="PDF/scratchanimation.pdf" target="_blank">assignment</a> that taught us some Scratch animation basics
				 		that we used to create a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/171997928/" target="_blank">simple story</a>.Our interactive story had
				 		multiple riddles that progressively got harder as the player advanced through the game. Throughout the game,
				 		the player has to use their arrow keys on the keyboard to maneuver the character around the screen in order to "touch"
				 		the object that is the answer to the riddle. The theme of our project was an Escape Room, and the 
				 		main objective of the game was to make it out of the mansion that you start in.

				 		<p><b>Project:</b> Python Image Manipulation Project</p>
				 		<p><b>Course:</b> CSE (Computer Science and Engineering)</p>
				 		<p><b>Duration:</b> August 2017 - September 2017</p>
				 		<p><b>Objective:</b> Create a program that manipulates a folder of images all at once for a client</p>
				 		<p><b>Type of Project:</b> Collaborative Coding</p>
				 		</br>
				 		<p>For the Python Image Manipulation Project, my partner, Anika Chekuri, and I had to
				 		first choose a client to create a program for. We chose <a href="http://www.norsled.org/" traget="_blank">Norsled</a> as our cause, and strived to create a program that would make all of their pictures uniform and look professional.
				 		The <a href="PDF/image_artist.pdf" target="_blank">requirements</a> were that we had to cater the customer and provide a program that would satisfy their needs.
				 		We were graded according to this <a href="PDF/image_rubric.pdf" target="_blank"rubric></a>. Previously, we had been given
				 		many assignments, such as <a href="PDF/python_assignment.pdf" target="_blank"></a>, that taught us the basics of image manipulation using PIL and NumPy. These assignments created
				 		results that can be seen <a href="PDF/python_images.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
				 		Our image manipulation program resized all of the images to be uniform, added the Norsled logo to the 
				 		bottom left corner, and added a navy blue frame around the images. The user could change the parameters of
				 		various methods in order to change the border color, border thickness, logo placement, logo size, image size,
				 		and image dimensions. We also created a <a href="PDF/slideshow.pdf" target="_blank">slideshow</a> to showcase our image manipulations.
