                    <p> Audrey Kang is an ambitious young woman who hopes to have a career
                        in criminology, in either the prosecution or investigation aspects of it, in the future. 
                        After high school, Audrey hopes to get a PhD
                        in law at either Columbia, Stanford, Harvard, or Yale. 
                        She has always had a love for learning as well as a strong sense for 
                        doing right in the world, so she believes that legislature is the best 
                        career for her. Audrey has constantly excelled in Language Arts
                        throughout her years of schooling and will continue to take 
                        challenging courses to prepare herself for her future occupation. 
                        She is currently a sophomore at Dublin High School, and has already 
                        acquired a sizable sum of leadership positions and experience
                        that will help her achieve her career goal.

                    <p>
                        Audrey Kang is the Community
                        Service Coordinator of the California Scholarship Federation at her school.
                        She uses her leadership skills and inclination towards service to create volunteering
                        opportunities for the students at her school. She hopes to make a difference
                        in the world and help her peers achieve the same.

                    <p> Along with her dedication 
                  towards service, Audrey
                  also excels academically. As a freshman,
                  Audrey was in AP Human Geography, Honors Mandarin, and Advanced English.
                  She has continued to apply her love of learning in her sophomore year courses,
                  including AP Europen History, AP Mandarin, Advanced English 2, and AP Chemistry.
                  Her lifelong learning habits have enabled her to be an outstanding student, 
                  both in terms of academic achievement and in helping the community.
                  Her love for Language Arts has also compelled Audrey to become a staff writer
                  her school newspaper, the Dublin Shield. She writes an average of an article
                  a week to inform students about the happenings of Dublin High and the world 
                  around them.  Additionally, Audrey is also a peer tutor in the Hub at DHS,
                  and you can find her on 
                  Tuesdays and Thursdays during 4th period helping out her fellow students
                  in a variety of subjects. She hopes to become more involved in the drama
                  department at DHS, as well as learn as much as she can in her two short
                  years of high school left. Audrey is also a part
                  of Key Club, D26 South, and is a proud blue devil, as well as an active
                  member of INTERACT.

                    <p>In addition to these activities, Audrey is also a 
                  member of Dublin High's Varsity Song Team, which performs at basketball
                  games and various rallies. Audrey has been dancing for over ten years,
                  and her love of dancing has also landed her the role of a fairy in DHS's
                  2017 production of A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare. She 
                  has done a variety of dance styles over the years, ranging from lyrical to
                  jazz to contemporary dance. Her achievements include winning first place 
                  at KAR's 2016 Nationals in Las Vegas for her small group dance, as well as
                  third place at the same competition for her trio. She hopes to continue
                  developing her skills both as a dancer and an actor in the future through
                  appearing in more drama productions and practicing with her Song Team.

                    <p>Audrey's love of learning is ultimately the reason why this website was made.
                   Although she is pursuing a major in the Language Arts, 
                   she was nonetheless interested in learning about the computer sciences as well. 
                   This curiosity and thirst for knowledge has led to this webpage's creation, 
                   and she hopes you enjoy looking through her projects, photos, resume, and more!
